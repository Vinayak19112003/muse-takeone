# TraceReel

Turn AI-agent browser traces into polished demo videos.

Live agent footage is jumpy: every pause while the model thinks ends up on camera. TraceReel splits the job. Your agent captures screenshots and a state/action trace from the browser it actually drives — with its real logged-in state, not a fresh headless browser pretending to be you. Then TraceReel reconstructs a full recording from that trace: eased 60 Hz cursor glides, click ripples, per-character typing, settled camera shots, crossfades — rendered at 1080p, 60 fps.

```

The renderer never sees agent identity. Adapters normalize each agent's trace format into one neutral Trace Format v1; the video plan is computed from that, so adding a new agent means writing an adapter, not touching the renderer.

**Status of integrations:** Muse is the tested reference integration. The architecture is fully generic — Grokbot is a planned/reference integration, and any future agent's traces normalize through the same pipeline with no renderer changes.

## Install

TraceReel installs from this repository (it is not published to npm):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vinayak19112003/tracereel.git
cd tracereel
npm ci
npm run build
```

Then check the machine: `tracereel doctor` (node ≥ 20, ffmpeg, a Chromium renderer, disk space). `npm link` gives you a global `tracereel`. The old `takeone` and `muse-takeone` commands still work but print a deprecation warning.

The bundled skill teaches an agent the whole workflow — see [`skills/tracereel/SKILL.md`](skills/tracereel/SKILL.md). Agent-specific capture skills live under [`skills/adapters/`](skills/adapters/).

## The workflow

```
generate → validate --json → repair → inspect --json → repair → render → QA → rerender
```

```bash
tracereel validate trace.json --json   # machine-readable schema + semantics check
tracereel inspect trace.json --json    # what will happen: agent, states, shots, timing, QA
tracereel reconstruct trace.json -o demo.mp4
# optional narration + music (agent supplies the audio files; TraceReel mixes):
tracereel audio demo.mp4 --trace trace.json -o demo-narrated.mp4 --subtitles both
```

A trace is states and actions, not frames and hacks:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "source": { "type": "agent-browser", "agent": "muse", "session": "main" },
  "viewport": { "width": 1919, "height": 992 },
  "states": [
    { "id": "home", "screenshot": "01-open.png", "caption": "Open the repo" },
    { "id": "merged", "screenshot": "02-merged.png", "caption": "Merged" }
  ],
  "actions": [
    { "kind": "click", "from": "home", "to": "merged", "x": 1520, "y": 147, "stateDelayMs": 900 }
  ]
}
```

Prefer states + actions. The older frames-with-actions form still works — TraceReel converts it to states internally — and `muse-managed-browser` provenance from v0.1.x normalizes to `agent-browser` / agent `muse` with a deprecation warning.

The full input contract lives in [`docs/TRACE_FORMAT.md`](docs/TRACE_FORMAT.md) and [`schema/reconstruction.schema.json`](schema/reconstruction.schema.json). Annotated examples in [`examples/`](examples/). Programmatic traces via the TypeScript SDK:

```ts
import { TraceBuilder } from "tracereel";

const t = new TraceBuilder({ agent: "muse", viewport: { width: 1919, height: 992 } });
t.state("home", "01-open.png", { caption: "Open the repo." });
t.state("merged", "02-merged.png", { caption: "Merged." });
t.click({ from: "home", to: "merged", x: 1520, y: 147, stateDelayMs: 900 });
const trace = t.build();
```

Portable bundles — one directory with the trace, its frames, and metadata:

```bash
tracereel import agent-output.json --adapter muse -o demo.tracereel
tracereel reconstruct demo.tracereel/trace.json -o demo.mp4
```

**Capture rules that matter:**

- The screenshots must come from **the browser the agent is already driving** — its logged-in state, cookies, avatar, theme. Never launch another browser to obtain footage; TraceReel's Chromium is for **rendering only** and never browses the target site.
- One UI state per screenshot: capture before *and* after every UI-changing action, settled, never mid-animation.
- Screenshots usually contain the OS cursor baked in — paint it out per frame before rendering, or the video shows two cursors.
- `source.type` is **declarative provenance metadata**, not cryptographic proof. `--require-source muse-managed-browser` keeps working and fails loudly on the wrong source — no silent fresh-Chromium footage, ever.

**Camera philosophy: SHOT = CAMERA MOVE.** The camera is planned in settled shots, not clicks. Nearby interactions share one framing; cuts never move the camera (short output-time crossfade); reframes are direct, never zoom-out/zoom-in; only the final shot releases to the overview. See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

**Local by default.** Reconstruction and rendering happen on your machine. TraceReel never uploads your screenshots, traces, or videos anywhere. Redact regions at copy time (`redactions: [{ x, y, width, height, mode: "blur" | "solid" | "pixelate" }]`) — the pixels never reach the video. `{ "kind": "type", "sensitive": true }` hides the key pill. Never type real credentials for a demo; use fake ones. Treat the frames directory like credentials. More: [`docs/privacy.md`](docs/privacy.md).

**Verified platforms:** Linux VPS, node 20+, a system Chromium path, system or bundled ffmpeg. macOS and Windows are not verified yet.

**Describe the result honestly:** "reconstructed from real screenshots" (real frames, rebuilt cursor path) — never "a captured live recording". See [`docs/limitations.md`](docs/limitations.md).

| `tracereel render <dir>` | re-render a kept work dir (`--keep-work-dir`) with different styling |
| `tracereel assemble ./frames` | Ken Burns-style video from stills, no cursor (upstream feature) |
| `tracereel setup` | download Chromium once, check ffmpeg (upstream feature) |

The original takeone workflow (rehearse live → export scenario → record) is fully intact for agents that drive their own browser. The reconstruction features above are the TraceReel additions; upstream functionality is documented in [`skills/tracereel/references/scenario-api.md`](skills/tracereel/references/scenario-api.md).

## How it works

`reconstruct` normalizes the trace through the agent adapter, copies the screenshots into a working dir (applying redactions), writes a `manifest.json` with `mode: "reconstructed"`, and synthesizes the 60 Hz cursor/click/key event stream plus camera shots from the state/action plan. The compositor then renders the video from that manifest, split across browser workers that each encode a segment with ffmpeg. Cursor path and camera moves are computed from the log, not from the capture, so they stay smooth even when the page stutters. Output is H.264 MP4 by default, or VP9 WebM.

The render is deterministic: the same trace always produces the same video. Crossfades are measured in output time and every frame names its own images, so parallel workers can't disagree. (The intermediate manifest stamps a wall-clock `createdAt` for provenance; it is metadata only and never affects a pixel.)
